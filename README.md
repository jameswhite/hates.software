Tape for broken windows.

Just a repository for reproducing the broken stuff I find in software. I put a directory for each problem under the [`software`](https://github.com/jameswhite/hates.software/tree/master/software) directory that includes a vagrant file that will create a vagrant box and replicate the problem. A makefile is provided so really the only instructions should be switch to the directory and run `make`. Run `make-clean` to :fire: the virtualbox vm. (Obviously vagrant and virtualbox are prerequisites to use this.)
